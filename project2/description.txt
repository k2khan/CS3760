#Suguru Solver

#Update 2/28/2020
#First Submission:
#The current implementation uses consistency checking and basic inference. 
#When coding this up, I think the most difficult thing was to understand the logic.
#For example, for infer, you have to push a location back into changedLocations if the possibleRemainingValues equals one. 
#Coming up with the neighboring tiles was also something that took me a while. 
#I actually really enjoyed working on this, I just have not had enough time, especially due to umslHack, to implement more funcionality and thorougly test my code.

#What improvements I want to make:
#According to the leaderboard, I currently produce an incorrect solution, so I will have to check my code for that. 
#I also want to add at least another level of inference and the MRV heuristic. Some of my code could also be streamlined, so I intend to make the code that finds neighbors into a function, and to comment more of the code in general.

#Update 3/1/2020
#I've implemented the MRV Heuristic.
#findNeighbors() is now a function that finds all possible true neighbors of a location
#I've added two inferences:
#First technique: https://dkmgames.com/Suguru/SuguruTutBasic.htm
#Second technique: https://dkmgames.com/Suguru/SuguruTutAdvanced.htm
#Surprisingly had a lot of fun while writing code for this solver, especially cause I had to really think a lot about what I was doing
#Also, hail print debugging
