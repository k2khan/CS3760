Performance 93.90
-----------------

You performance is very good.

Code

I'm providing comments on your current version, which I know is improved
since your original submission.  You are calculating the Manhattan
metric and then multiplying by 1.13333.  This is not an admissible
heuristic.  For the examples that were tested against this happens to
return an optimal solution.  But I have other examples in my test suite
that it does not.  You should make sure you use an admissible heuristic
so that your implementation always returns an optimal solution.  If you
want to speed things up, consider better heuristics like the "walking
distance".

Description
-----------

Good.  Plese discuss each of your improvements (and attempts to 
improve).
